# AgriculturalWaterUsage

Approximately 1% of the Earth's water is freshwater. As population grows so does the strain on our finite water resources. Using Agricultural Water Usage Calculator people can educate themselves on the impact of the cultivation of the crops they consume. The user can input a crop field size in acres and select a crop type. Using data from academic journals the user's input is converted into the amount of gallons used to cultivate one harvest of that crop.
